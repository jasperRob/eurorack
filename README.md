# My Eurorack Modules

I would like to track my journey into the wonderful world of Eurorack Modular Synthesisers, so I have designated this repo to exactly that.

Each project will have it's own sub directory for code, notes and images, and I may even make some build videos of them to post on Youtube for anyone interested.
