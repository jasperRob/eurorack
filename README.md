# My Eurorack Modules

I would like to track my journey into the wonderful world of Eurorack Modular Synthesisers, so i have designated theis repo to exactly that.

Each project will have it's own sub directory for code, notes and images, and I may even make some build videos of them to post on Youtube for anyone interested.


## 1. Simple LFO

A very simple LFO module with SQR or TRI wave capability.


## 2. TNGF 8 Step Sequencer

A neat 8 step sequencer with backward/forward capability.
