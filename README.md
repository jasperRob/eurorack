# My Eurorack Modules

&nbsp;

**What is this?**

I would like to track my journey into the wonderful world of Eurorack Modular Synthesisers, so I have designated this repo for exactly that.

&nbsp;

**Future plans?**

Each project will have it's own sub directory for code, notes and images, and I may even make some build videos of them to post on Youtube for anyone interested.

&nbsp;

**Disclaimer**

If any of the material in this repo is yours without credit being given, it is not intentional. I'd be more than happy to so please contact me about it.
